When I chat with developers, they say progress was quick at first, but now each new feature is a bigger time sink. They spend ages figuring out how to weave it into the codebase, which often leads to more bugs and even more time fixing them. The code base now looks like patches on patches; it's like conducting an archaeological dig to understand how it all works. This load slows down new features and makes devs wish they could start from scratch.

当我和软件开发人员交谈时，他们告诉我，一开始能够迅速取得进展，但现在添加新功能需要花费更多时间。每个新功能都需要更多时间来理解如何将其融入现有的代码库，一旦添加后，通常会出现更多的错误，需要更长时间来修复。代码库开始看起来像一系列覆盖补丁的补丁，需要进行考古学研究才能弄清楚事情是如何工作的。这种负担减慢了添加新功能的速度，甚至让开发人员希望他们可以从一张空白的纸重新开始。
