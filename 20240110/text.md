I admit, I don't always tread lightly and take baby steps, but whenever things get tough, my first instinct is to scale back my stride. Particularly in the process of refactoring, if my tests flop and I can't promptly pinpoint and rectify the issue, I backtrack to my last good commit and replay my steps more minutely. This tactic works because I make frequent commits and these small increments are instrumental in quick progress, especially when grappling with tough code.
