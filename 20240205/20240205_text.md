前几天我老婆说我每天起床很早，都有点打扰她睡觉了。为了在我早起的时候不影响到她，我做了几件事情来解决影响她睡觉的问题。

首先就是手机闹钟设置为震动模式，而不是铃声模式；

然后就是每天早上拉开窗帘的时候，动作轻一点；

最后就是朗读的时候声音小一些。

通过做好这几件事，既没耽误我朗读，也没影响到我老婆。

还是那句话，只要是内心真正渴望想做的事情，办法总比困难多。

The other day, my wife mentioned that my early wake-up was disturbing her sleep. To address this, I made a few changes to minimize the disturbance.

First, I switched my phone alarm to vibrate mode instead of sound.

Then, I made sure to open the curtains more gently in the morning.

Lastly, I lowered my voice when reading aloud.

By making these adjustments, I could continue my reading without disrupting my wife.

As the saying goes, where there’s a will, there’s always a way to overcome obstacles for things that truly matter.
