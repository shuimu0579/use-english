今天早上 6 点钟就起床了，天还没亮，打开了阳台上的灯。打开电脑，电脑的强光晃的眼睛睁不开，这样持续了两三分钟眼睛才能正常的看着屏幕。

今天是早晨朗读的第十天了，发现自己这段早晨的时光还是很享受的，每次心无旁骛的朗读英文，不知不觉就到早晨 7 点钟，一天的活动真正开始了。

Got up at 6 AM while it was still dark out and flicked on the balcony light. When I fired up the computer, the screen's glare was so intense I couldn't keep my eyes open for a good two or three minutes.

It's been ten days of morning reading sessions, and I'm actually loving this peaceful time. Zeroing in on my English reading, time flies until 7 AM, kicking off my day for real.
