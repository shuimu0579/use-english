还有一个星期就可以回家了，很期待这个春节假期。在外面幸苦了一年，先回去好好的过个年。

努力工作很重要，但是充分的休息也很重要。

休息不是躺在沙发上刷手机，而是去做一些需要集中注意力的活动。

比如为家人做一桌饭菜，比如去家乡的景点看看，比如和老朋友聚聚。

Only one more week until I can go home, really looking forward to the Spring Festival holiday. After working hard outside for a year, I want to go back and have a good time celebrating the New Year.

Working hard is important, but getting enough rest is also crucial.

Resting isn't just lying on the couch and scrolling through your phone, it's doing activities that require concentration.

Such as cooking a meal for family, visiting hometown attractions, or getting together with old friends.
