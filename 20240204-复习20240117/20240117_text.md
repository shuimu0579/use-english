最近在看《重构—改善既有代码的设计》这本书，书里面讲到了重构和单元测试的结合，有助于实施真正意义上的敏捷开发。没有重构和单元测试的敏捷开发就是“假敏捷”。

对于这样的英文版技术书籍，不用追求看的有多快，而是要真正的看懂，重要的是对自己的编码实践有帮助。在阅读重构这本书的过程中，我提醒自己要真看真学真练真用，不要再进行假学习了。

I've been reading "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code." The book highlights how merging refactoring with unit testing can lead to genuine agile development. Without them, it's just lip service to agility.

With tech books like this, the goal isn't speed-reading; it's comprehension. The key is that it should boost my coding skills. As I dive into "Refactoring," I'm reminding myself to truly read, learn, practice, and apply the concepts—no more faking it.
