今天周五了，下周一开始公司就开启了新的组织架构。
还是挺期待公司的这种变化的，希望自己在 2024 年的工作能够顺利一些。

还有半个月就要回家过年了, 在外面辛苦了一年，过年可以回家去陪陪父母，和家人们吃吃喝喝聊聊，将绷紧的弦暂时松懈下来，为来年的奋斗积蓄力量。

It's finally Friday, and come Monday, our company rolls out a new organizational structure.
I'm pretty stoked about this change and hope it'll smooth out my work in 2024.

Only two weeks left before I head home for the New Year's celebration. After grinding all year, it'll be great to chill with my parents, feast with the fam, and recharge for another year of hustling.
