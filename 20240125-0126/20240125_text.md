终于把 mini-react 刷副本这个项目从头到尾跟完了，整个跟下来耗费了 20 个小时是有的，也就是用 10 天的时间，每天花 2 个小时。这个时间的投入还是比较大的。

那么参加这个活动花了多少钱呢？才花了 30 块钱。花的钱少，花的时间多，这应该是很多学习活动的共同特征。

由此想到为什么很多人愿意花钱买课，但是基本不会去花大量时间学习和练习？根本原因还是花钱相对容易，但是花时间就是很难的。

这提醒我时间是比钱更重要的资源，将时间转化为激光般的专注力，去努力的从事生产活动。

I finally completed the mini-react replica project from start to finish, which took a total of 20 hours, spread out over 10 days, with 2 hours dedicated to it each day.

The time investment was quite substantial.

As for the cost of participating in this activity, it was only $30.

It's a common characteristic of many learning activities that they require a relatively small financial investment but a significant amount of time.

This leads me to wonder why many people are willing to pay for courses but are generally reluctant to spend a large amount of time on learning and practice.

The fundamental reason is that spending money is relatively easy, while spending time is quite challenging.

This serves as a reminder that time is a more valuable resource than money.

Transforming time into laser-like focus is essential for engaging diligently in productive activities.
