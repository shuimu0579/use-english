今天早上起床，老婆说她昨晚没有睡好。

我问她为什么没睡好，她说昨晚半夜椅子突然掉了，吓了她一跳。

还有就是我早上起来上厕所，开门关门的声音也弄醒她了。

所以我以后要采取几个措施：

1、在椅子打开的情况下抵住门。

2、工作日早上上厕所的时候尽量晚一点。

3、周末的时候早上直接去口袋公园那边上厕所，然后朗读和跑步。

This morning, my wife told me she didn't sleep well last night.

I asked her why, and she said the chair fell in the middle of the night, which startled her.

Also, when I got up to use the bathroom, the door opening and closing woke her up.

So, I plan to take a few measures:

1. Prop the door with the chair when it's open.
2. Try to use the bathroom a bit later on workday mornings.
3. On weekends, go to the restroom near the pocket park in the morning, then do some reading and jogging.
