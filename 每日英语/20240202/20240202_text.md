每天早上朗读英语，已经三周了。这时候自己会感觉有些懈怠，怀疑自己这样做到底有没有效果。其实这样的时刻就更不应该放弃。不要自我怀疑，先盲从大师的建议，听话照做就行了。不管怎么样，先保质保量的完成，只要去做了，结果就不会太差的。

I've been reading English out loud every morning for three weeks.

Sometimes I feel a bit sluggish and wonder if it's really making a difference.

But that's exactly when I shouldn't give up.

Instead of doubting myself, I should just follow the expert advice and stick to it.

No matter what, I should just focus on getting it done, and the results won't be too bad as long as I keep at it.
