Without regular refactoring, the internal design—architecture—of software tends to degrade. When people modify code to meet short-term goals without fully grasping the architecture, it loses its structure. It becomes increasingly difficult to discern the design by reviewing the code. This loss of structure tends to snowball; the harder it is to see the design in the code, the harder it becomes to maintain, and the more rapidly it decays. Frequent refactoring helps keep the code in good health.

在不进行重构的情况下，软件的内部设计——架构——往往会衰退。当人们为了实现短期目标而更改代码时，往往没有完全理解架构，代码就会失去结构。通过阅读代码来看到设计变得更加困难。代码结构的丧失具有累积效应。代码中的设计越难以看到，我就越难以保持它，它就会更快地衰退。定期进行重构有助于保持代码的良好状态。
