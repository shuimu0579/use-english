今天看到《软技能》这本书里面讲到，每天写日报并且每周写周报给上级。

这样做的好处有两个：

第一点就是方便回顾过去一段时间都完成了哪些工作，还有哪些工作未完成。方便下一个阶段调整行动。

第二点就是让你的直接上级领导知道你在做什么，便于领导对下属的管理，最终让自己在领导面前有存在感。

In the book "Soft Skills" I read today, it mentions the importance of writing daily reports and weekly reports for superiors.

This practice has two main benefits:

Firstly, it helps in reviewing what tasks have been completed and what is pending, facilitating adjustments for the next steps.

Secondly, it keeps your immediate supervisor informed about your activities, aiding in better management of subordinates and ultimately enhancing your visibility in front of leadership.
