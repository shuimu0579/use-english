不知不觉中已经持续朗读英语三周了，每天晚上 10 点左右睡觉，早上 5 点半左右起来，对于现在的我来说，已经养成习惯了。

每天朗读 3 个小时，我现在还没有达到这个朗读的强度，每天只有朗读 1 个半小时。

还是要再起早一些，抓住早上这个宝贵的时间，为这一年的英语学习提高坚实的时间保障。

I've been reading English continuously for three weeks, going to bed around 10 PM and getting up around 5:30 AM without realizing it. It's become a habit for me now.

I haven't reached the three-hour reading goal yet; currently, I'm only reading for about an hour and a half each day.

I need to wake up even earlier to make the most of the precious morning time and ensure solid time commitment for English learning throughout the year.
