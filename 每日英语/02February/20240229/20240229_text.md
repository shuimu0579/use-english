一小段的英文，想要达到熟练背诵的程度，也不是那么容易的。

我由此想到了一句话：一切都靠积累。因为积累的过程就是建设大脑皮层的过程。

从 0 到 1 建设大脑皮层，从来都不会一蹴而就，从来都是需要时间和注意力来填充的。

没有什么捷径，没有什么速成，还是要老老实实的投入时间和注意力。

Mastering a short English passage isn't as easy as it sounds. That reminds me of the saying, "Everything boils down to accumulation," because the process of accumulation is what builds the brain's cortex.

Building the brain's cortex from scratch isn't something that happens overnight; it requires time and attention to fill in the gaps.

There are no shortcuts or quick fixes; you simply have to put in the time and attention diligently.
