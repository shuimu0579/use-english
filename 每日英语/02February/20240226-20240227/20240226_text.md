2024 年已经过了两个月了，时间总是这样，不管不顾的流逝，不管你在这个段时间内做没做事。

静下心来，集中自己的注意力，花费足够的时间来学好英语。

一个人长大的过程，其实就是用自己的时间换取才华的过程。如果人长大了，才华没有得到增长，这就是虚度了光阴。

It's already two months into 2024, time just keeps passing by, regardless of what you've been up to during this time.

Take a moment to focus, dedicate enough time to mastering English.

Growing up is essentially exchanging time for skills. If one grows older without enhancing skills, time has been wasted.
