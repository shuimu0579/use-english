历时 10 来天的春节假期结束了，这个假期还是很充实的。

看了场电影，写了篇读后感，逛了逛家乡那些好玩的地方，和家里人好好的联络了一下感情。

新的一年主要要把时间花在了英语的学习上，每天练习 3 个小时，跟着社群里的节奏走。

至于其他的事情，该屏蔽的屏蔽，该放弃的放弃。专心做好既定的事情。

The 10-day Chinese New Year holiday just ended, and it was quite fulfilling.

I watched a movie, wrote a reflection, explored fun spots in my hometown, and connected with family.

In the new year, my focus will be on studying English, dedicating three hours daily and following the community's pace.

I'll prioritize English learning and block out distractions, staying committed to my goals.
