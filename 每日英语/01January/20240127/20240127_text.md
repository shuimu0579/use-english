由此想到为什么很多人愿意花钱买课，但是基本不会去花大量时间学习和练习？根本原因还是花钱相对容易，但是花时间就是很难的。

这提醒我时间是比钱更重要的资源，将时间转化为激光般的专注力，去努力的从事生产活动。

This leads me to wonder why many people are willing to pay for courses but are generally reluctant to spend a large amount of time on learning and practice.

The fundamental reason is that spending money is relatively easy, while spending time is quite challenging.

This serves as a reminder that time is a more valuable resource than money.

Transforming time into laser-like focus is essential for engaging diligently in productive activities.
