今天开始看《软技能》这本书，书里讲到作为一个程序员，不光是要写代码，还要全方位的提升自己。全方位的提升自己，使自己成为更完整的人。包括怎么打造自己的品牌，怎么做市场营销，怎么保持自己的身体强壮和心理健康，怎么开创自己的事业。

给别人打工是没有前途的，一定要想方设法为自己工作，自己的金钱、时间、注意力自己掌控。

I started reading "Soft Skills" today, which emphasizes that as a programmer, it's not just about coding, but about overall personal development.

This includes building your brand, marketing, maintaining physical and mental well-being, and starting your own business.

Working for others has no future.

It's crucial to find ways to work for yourself and take control of your money, time, and attention.
