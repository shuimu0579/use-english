从 1 月 10 号开始，练习英语口语有 3 个月了。这三个月的时间里，我基本都是自己一个人独自练习，练习完之后就写一下每天的训练日记。

在翻看训练日记的过程中，我发现了几个问题，首先我每天的练习时长根本没有 3 个小时，大概只有早晨的一个半小时，也就是只是练习了要求时长的一半。其次在早上这一个半小时练习时间内，我还会刷手机资讯，没有做到全身心的投入。

练不好英语不如去死了算了，一定要先改正上面的两个问题。我想到的解决方案就是，首先每天早上 5 点钟起来，9 点 30 就去睡觉，然后在上班通勤路上再背诵半个小时；其次用另一个备用手机来录音，而不是下载了资讯软件的那个手机。

I've been practicing spoken English for 3 months since January 10th. During this time, I've mostly practiced alone and then written a daily training diary.

Reviewing my training diary, I noticed a couple of issues. Firstly, I haven't been practicing for the full 3 hours as intended, only about an hour and a half each morning. Secondly, during this time, I've been distracted by checking news on my phone, not fully focused.

If I can't improve my English, I might as well give up. I must address these two issues. My solution is to wake up at 5 a.m. daily, go to bed by 9:30 a.m., and then review for another half hour during my commute to work. Additionally, I'll use a spare phone for recording instead of the one with news apps.
