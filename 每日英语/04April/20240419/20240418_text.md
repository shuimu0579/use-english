这两天申请的招商银行 Visa 信用卡、中银香港储蓄卡、深圳户口的新身份证都到了，用心准备后获得的结果都还不错，心里还是挺高兴的。

不用高估努力的重要性，但是也不能放弃努力，自己能做的事情还是要好好的准备。在拼尽全力之后，剩下的就交给运气和时间，有好结果当然很好，如果没有取得预想的结果，也能做到问心无愧。

另一方面来说，也要保持良好的心态，不要叹气，不要抱怨，相信自己会有意外的好运。良好的心态加上不懈的努力，默默守护着自己的好运气，最终一定会有不错的结果。

I recently received my new Visa credit card from China Merchants Bank, savings card from Bank of China Hong Kong, and updated ID card from Shenzhen. I put in effort preparing for them and am pleased with the positive outcomes.

It's important not to underestimate the value of hard work, yet also crucial not to give up. After giving it your all, leave the rest to luck and time. Good results are great, but even if things don't go as planned, you can still be proud of your efforts.

Maintaining a positive mindset is key. Avoid sighing or complaining, and believe in unexpected good fortune. With a good attitude and persistent effort, silently guarding your luck, you will eventually achieve favorable outcomes.
