英语口语的练习过程，有两点是很重要的：首先就是英语材料的音一定要读准；然后就是英语材料一定要能背下来。

英语材料的音要读准，就需要先了解人体发声的方式，熟练掌握元音和辅音的发声。更关键的是，在平时的口语练习中有意识的纠正元音和辅音的发音。

将英语材料背下来的过程，就是不断扩充我们大脑容量的过程，也是真正健脑的过程。记忆能力是需要不断的持续训练的，它将成为我们一生都受用的能力。

In the process of practicing spoken English, two key points are crucial: firstly, accurately pronouncing the sounds in English materials; secondly, being able to memorize the English materials.

To pronounce English sounds accurately, it's essential to understand how the human voice works and master the pronunciation of vowels and consonants. Moreover, consciously correcting the pronunciation of vowels and consonants during regular spoken practice is crucial.

Memorizing English materials is a process of expanding our brain capacity continuously, and it is also a genuine brain-boosting process. Memory capacity requires ongoing and consistent training, which will become a valuable skill for us throughout our lives.
