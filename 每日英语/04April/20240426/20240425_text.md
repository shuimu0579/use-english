经过三天的时间，终于能把一段英文日记背下来了，这三天累计训练了 3 个半小时。由此想到，只要我肯花时间，还是能够顺利的背下来英文日记的。

每天早上训练两个小时，这段时间不管是学英语还是学习编程或者安安静静的做点自己的事情，都是很有效率的。每天持续的训练，然后每天写训练日记，持续的自我监督，真的就没有学不会的东西。

明明知道了这么多道理，却过不好这一生。因为知道和做到之间，隔着一个通过漫长训练而成长起来的大脑皮层，那完全就是 0 和 1 的区别。

After three days of practice, I finally managed to memorize a piece of English diary, totaling 3 and a half hours of training. This made me realize that with dedication, I can successfully memorize an English diary.

Spending two hours each morning on training, whether it's learning English, programming, or simply doing something I enjoy, has proven to be very productive. Consistent daily practice, followed by writing a training diary, and continuous self-monitoring, really leaves no room for failure in learning.

Despite knowing all these principles, I struggle to live my life to the fullest. The gap between knowing and doing is bridged by a well-trained brain cortex, which is like the difference between 0 and 1.
