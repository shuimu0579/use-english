2024 年一季度的绩效结果出来了，感觉很不理想，在当前的公司应该是呆不久了，我应该要开始准备找工作。

这段时间好好复习一下前端的基础知识，为离职后的面试做好准备。哪怕现在找工作很艰难，也不能躺平，也要努力的去找工作，毕竟我是家里的经济支柱。

有一句话说的好：让人上瘾的有海洛因、碳水、还有工资。现在打工只是权宜之计，是为了积蓄力量从而将来不用打工，是为了不需要一份工资而出卖自己的时间，最终做到时间上和注意力上的自由。

The performance results for the first quarter of 2024 are disappointing. It seems like staying in the current company may not be a good idea. I should start preparing to find a new job.

During this period, I will review the basics of front-end development to prepare for interviews after resigning. Even though job hunting is tough now, I can't just sit back and relax. I must make an effort to find a job, as I am the main breadwinner in my family.

As the saying goes, "Addictive substances include heroin, carbs, and salary." Working now is just a temporary solution to save up strength for the future. The goal is to not rely on a job, to avoid selling my time for a salary, and ultimately achieve freedom in terms of time and attention.
