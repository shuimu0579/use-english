现在国内的经济环境不好，很多企业的生存都很艰难，我们公司现在就是这么个情况，指不定自己哪一天就被裁了。

都说打工是没有前途的，打工也不可能打一辈子，还是要早做准备，来应对最坏的情况。首先要尽力的去提升自己的编程专业能力和英语能力，找外企相关的工作，或者远程工作。

更重要的是，不断的去尝试新的可能，多接触外面的世界，为不用给别人打工，自己当老板而努力。

The current economic situation in the country is tough, many companies are struggling to survive, including the one I work for. It's uncertain when we might face layoffs.

It's often said that working for others has limited prospects and isn't a lifelong option. It's crucial to start preparing early for the worst-case scenario. One should focus on improving programming skills and English proficiency, aiming for jobs in foreign companies or remote positions.

Moreover, it's essential to continuously explore new opportunities, engage with the outside world, and strive towards being one's own boss instead of working for others.
