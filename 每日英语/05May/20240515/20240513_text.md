最近在开跨境电商网店，店铺一直没有什么流量。心里也是挺着急的，但是着急又没啥用。因为不管做什么事情，都没有什么捷径可走，都需要不断的积累。做跨境电商同样也是这种情况，没有半年一年甚至几年的默默积累，就没有可能等到收获的那一天。

不断的优化自己的店铺运营流程，提高各个环节的工作效率，善用 AI 辅助工具和 ERP 工具。如果店铺运营效率得到了提升，同时又降低了店铺运营成本，再配合货物购买成本和物流成本的降低，我的店铺才真的有竞争力。

店铺开始运营的三个月是最重要的，这期间多学习多实践，暂时没有好的产出也不要紧。顺利渡过这三个月，构建好自己的副业，也就是给自己多一个人生的选择。

I've recently started a cross-border e-commerce store, but it's been struggling with low traffic. Feeling anxious about it, but I know being anxious won't help. There are no shortcuts in anything; it all requires continuous effort and accumulation. The same goes for cross-border e-commerce – without months or even years of silent accumulation, the day of harvest won't come.

Constantly optimizing the store operation process, improving efficiency in every aspect, and utilizing AI and ERP tools. If the store operation efficiency is enhanced, operating costs are reduced, and combined with lower procurement and logistics costs, then my store will truly be competitive.

The first three months of store operation are crucial; during this period, focus on learning and practicing, even if there are no immediate results. Once these three months are successfully navigated, establish a solid side business, providing an additional life choice.
