最近两天早上没有朗读英文，而是在优化自己的电商平台店铺。我觉得哪怕再忙，也要给英文朗读挤出时间，每天的英文朗读是绝对不能放弃的。

持续不断的朗读英文，就是在不断的锻炼自己的大脑。一时半会儿可能没有什么区别，日子久了就能看出脑力的巨大区别，最终会体现在学习能力的巨大区别。

一定要坚持进行朗读训练，为了自己的大脑，为了自己孩子的健康成长，为了家族成为有未来的家族。先练上个一年半载，最好是一直练下去，练到足矣改变命运的那一天。

Lately, I've been focusing on optimizing my e-commerce store instead of reading English in the mornings. Even when busy, I believe it's crucial to make time for English reading every day.

Consistent English reading exercises the brain continuously. While it may not show immediate differences, over time, significant improvements in cognitive abilities will become evident.

It's essential to stick to the reading routine for the sake of brain health, personal growth, and securing a brighter future for oneself and one's children. Committing to this practice for at least a year or longer can potentially lead to life-changing outcomes.
