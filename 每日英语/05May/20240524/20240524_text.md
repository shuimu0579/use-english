最近除了在跨境电商网站上架商品之外，就是在学习 TypeScript。TS 被称为是 JS 的超集，作为 JS 的静态类型检查工具，为编写优雅健壮的 JS 代码而存在。

在学习 TS 的过程中，阅读相关书籍是必不可少的。如果仅仅是阅读相关书籍，并在阅读的过程中做笔记，可能还是不够的。还要花时间整理笔记，理清楚笔记之间的内在联系，最终更好的理解和吸收 TS 相关的知识。

除了阅读书籍做笔记整理笔记之外，还有更重要的一点，就是要将学到的东西运用到实际项目中，在实际项目中使用并理解相关的知识。我的个人博客网站项目就应该集成 TS，将学到的东西融合进项目中。

一段时间内只做一件事情，比如这两个月内只读 TS 相关的书籍。短时间内足够的重复，我们的大脑才会在短时间内接受到更多更强的刺激，才能真的掌握核心的技能。给自己一些耐心，给自己更多的时间，贪多嚼不烂，沉下心来切实的掌握 TS 这个技能。

Lately, besides listing products on cross-border e-commerce websites, I've been learning TypeScript. TS is known as a superset of JS and serves as a static type-checking tool for JS, existing to help write elegant and robust JS code.

In the process of learning TS, reading relevant books is essential. However, simply reading and taking notes while reading might not be enough. It’s also important to spend time organizing the notes, clarifying the internal connections between them, and ultimately better understanding and absorbing TS-related knowledge.

Beyond reading books, taking notes, and organizing those notes, it's even more crucial to apply what you've learned to actual projects. Using and understanding the relevant knowledge in real projects is vital. My personal blog website project should integrate TS, incorporating what I've learned into the project.

Focusing on one task for a period, such as spending the next two months solely reading TS-related books, is beneficial. Repeating a task enough times in a short period allows our brain to receive more intense stimuli in a short time, truly mastering core skills. Give yourself some patience and more time; trying to do too much at once will be counterproductive. Calm down and thoroughly master the skill of TS.
