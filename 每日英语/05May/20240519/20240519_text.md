不管做什么事情，都需要能够高度专注并集中注意力，才能把事情做好。没有长时间和高强度注意力的投入，就不可能获得满意的结果。

怎么训练自己的专注力，就是刻意训练自己集中注意力做事情的能力，比如早晨英文朗读，比如空闲的时候看几篇文章，每天都这样训练自己，最终就能慢慢锻炼自己的专注力。刚开始进步可能不明显，这时候给自己一些耐心，假以时日就能取得不错的成绩。

远离无谓的人和事，珍惜自己的时间和注意力，将他们注入到日常的训练中，一天又一天，一周又一周， 甚至一年又一年。不管是不是在假期，不管是不是有训练状态， 给我练，给我狠狠的练。

To do anything well, you need to focus and concentrate. Without long-term and intense attention, you can't get good results.

Training your focus means deliberately practicing your ability to concentrate. For example, read English aloud in the morning or read a few articles during your free time. Do this every day, and you'll gradually improve your focus. Progress might be slow at first, so be patient. Over time, you'll see good results.

Stay away from unnecessary people and things. Value your time and attention, and put them into your daily practice. Do this day after day, week after week, even year after year. Whether it's a holiday or not, whether you feel like it or not, keep practicing hard.
