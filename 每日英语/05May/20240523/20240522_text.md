从 2024 年 1 月 10 号开始，到今天 5 月 21 号，我已经持续的练习了四个月的英语口语。这期间有过多次的停顿，却没有长时间的停止，总之，这四个月我还是坚持下来了。

练习了 4 个月的英语口语，现在的问题是，我每天并没有做到练习 3 个小时，也就是每天练习的训练强度是不够的。

要想真正的学会东西，我们必须短时间内足够重复，如果没有做到短时间内足够重复，我们的大脑就难以建立牢固的持久的神经元连接。

这一年持续的英语口语拉练，是学会如何自学的必由之路，我一定要足够的重视。学不好英语口语，没法为自己的孩子树立榜样，没法省下更多子女教育的钱，没法建设学习型家庭，如果是这样，还不如去死了算了。

From January 10, 2024, to today, May 21, I have been practicing spoken English continuously for four months. Although there have been many pauses, I have not stopped for a long period, and overall, I have persisted over these four months.

Despite practicing spoken English for four months, the current issue is that I haven't managed to practice for three hours every day, meaning the intensity of my daily training is insufficient.

To truly learn something, we must repeat it enough times in a short period. Without sufficient repetition in a short time, our brains struggle to form strong and lasting neural connections.

This year-long continuous practice of spoken English is an essential path to learning how to teach myself. I must take it seriously. If I can't master spoken English, I won't be able to set an example for my child, save more money on their education, or build a learning-oriented family. If that's the case, I might as well be dead.
