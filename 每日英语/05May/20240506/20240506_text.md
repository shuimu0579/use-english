最近知道了一个观念：在你实力不够的时候，遇到别人对你的打压，不要去和别人对抗，默默的行动，不断的积累，这时候增强自己的实力才是最紧要的事情；当你实力足够的时候，如果别人对你造成了伤害，你就可以给于有利的回击。

在你和对方的实力差距很大的情况下，就不要采取以牙还牙以眼还眼的斗争策略了，由于你的实力较差，你是得不到什么好结果的。心平气和的接受当前自己的境遇，默默的积累以图改变，这才是更好的策略。

说到底，修养这个东西，不是道德层面的产物，而是理性利益层面的考量。你有实力就会显得心平气和有修养，你没有实力就会情绪不稳一点就着。为了内心的平和，为了内在的修养，竭力提升自己的实力才是正途。

Recently, I came across a concept: when facing oppression from others due to your lack of strength, it's best not to retaliate but to silently work on improving yourself. Strengthening your own abilities is crucial during such times. Once you have enough strength, you can then respond favorably if someone harms you.

When there is a significant gap in strength between you and the other party, refraining from tit-for-tat retaliation is wise. Given your weaker position, engaging in such conflicts won't yield positive outcomes. Accepting your current situation calmly and quietly accumulating resources for change is a better strategy.

Ultimately, the concept of cultivation is not just about morality but also about rational self-interest. When you have strength, you appear composed and cultivated; when lacking strength, emotions may be unstable. Striving to enhance your abilities is the right path for inner peace and personal growth.
