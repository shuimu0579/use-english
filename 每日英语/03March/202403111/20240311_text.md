一旦你选择了正确的道路并且采取了正确的行动，比如每天早上 5 点钟起来练习英语，比如每天上下班途中阅读英文书籍，比如坚持定投数字货币基金 BOX，那么你根本没必要焦虑，因为好的未来终将在未来展现。

你在好的社群里面成长，你接触到的也是全球一手的资讯，接下来就是日复一日的实践、试错、反馈、再实践的过程，就这样不断的循环往复，持续的迭代升级。

怀着平和的心态，远离社交网络的喧嚣，过着朴素的生活。有目标有事做有人爱，这就是一个人最好的护身符吧。

Once you've chosen the right path and taken the right actions, such as practicing English at 5 a.m. every morning, reading English books on your commute, and consistently investing in the cryptocurrency fund BOX, there's no need to worry because a bright future will eventually unfold.

Growing within a positive community and accessing global information firsthand, the key lies in the daily grind of practice, trial and error, feedback, and continuous improvement through this iterative process.

With a calm mindset, staying away from the noise of social media, and leading a simple life. Having goals, staying busy, and being loved - that's the best talisman one can have.
