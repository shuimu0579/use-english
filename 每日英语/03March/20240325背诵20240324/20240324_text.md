最近工作上的事情比较多，工作任务也很重，导致的结果就是晚上回到家，洗个澡就匆匆的睡觉了。

幸亏是每天坚持早起而不是晚睡，不然下班后就没有心思和精力去学点自己的东西了。将宝贵的时间留给自己，将垃圾时间留给别人，这才是一个好的时间分配策略。

对于早起学英语这件事，现在已经变成了我生活中的刚需，内心觉得一定要学会它，不学会就要了我自己的命。通过学好英语为抓手，训练自己的注意力，这是在人工智能时代的逃命之路，免于被时代洪流淹没的逃亡之旅。

Lately, work has been overwhelming with heavy tasks, leaving me rushing to bed after a quick shower upon returning home at night.

Thankfully, sticking to early mornings instead of staying up late allows me to have the energy and focus to learn something for myself after work. Prioritizing valuable time for self-improvement and allocating idle time to others is a smart time management strategy.

Making it a habit to learn English in the morning has become a necessity in my life. I feel compelled to master it, as it feels crucial for my survival. By honing my English skills, I am training my focus, paving my way to survival in the era of artificial intelligence, escaping the flood of the times and avoiding being swept away in the journey of escape.
