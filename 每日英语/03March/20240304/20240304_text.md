周末起床的比较晚，和工作日早晨 5 点钟起来相比，集中注意力的能力会差很多。

这样我能真切的感受到早起是多么的重要，用一天中注意力最集中的时间来做一天中最重要的那件事，这怎么样都是一件划算的事情。

光花钱不够，更重要的是要花时间；光花时间也不够，更重要的是要花费注意力；光有注意力还不够，最重要的是找到一直要做的事情--锻炼自己的大脑皮层，并投入高强度长时间的注意力。

Sleeping in on weekends affects my focus compared to waking up at 5 am on weekdays.

Experiencing this makes me realize the importance of early rising. It's beneficial to tackle the most important task during the peak focus hours of the day.

It's not just about spending money, but also about investing time. It's not only about spending time, but also about dedicating attention. Having attention is not enough; the key is to engage in activities that challenge the brain and require intense focus for a prolonged period.
