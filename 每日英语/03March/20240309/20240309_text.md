最近这段时间卸载了 Twitter，每天上班和下班通勤的路上，都在看英文原版书籍。

刚开始的时候，看一会儿书就觉得累，坚持了几天之后，发现能一直看近一个小时，而不会想着刷手机资讯。

那些练脑过程中的不适感，是我必须忍受的，一段时间之后脑力增强了，大脑也能适应这种阅读强度，之前的不适感可能仅仅是一种幻觉。

Lately, I've uninstalled Twitter and started reading English books during my daily commute to and from work.

At first, I felt tired after reading for a while, but after a few days, I found myself able to read for nearly an hour without the urge to check my phone for news.

The discomfort I experienced during the mental workout is something I have to endure. After some time, my mental strength has improved, and my brain has adapted to this reading intensity. The previous discomfort may have just been an illusion.
