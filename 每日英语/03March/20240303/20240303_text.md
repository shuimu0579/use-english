今天发现 openAI 公司的 API 禁止我使用了，那么我现在怎么将中文转化为英文，并且生成英文的语音呢？

如果生成不了英文语音的话，我早上就没有英文朗读材料了，当然也没有早上两个小时的英文练习机会了。

遇到了困难不可怕，可怕的是，你被困难吓到而裹足不前。这种时候就是考验你有多渴望完成设置的目标了。

Today, I found out that I can no longer use the openAI API. How can I now translate Chinese into English and generate English speech?

If I can't generate English speech, I won't have any English reading material in the morning, and I'll miss out on my two-hour English practice opportunity.

Facing difficulties is not scary; what's scary is being paralyzed by them. This is a test of how much you truly desire to achieve your goals.
