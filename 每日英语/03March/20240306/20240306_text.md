我们总是高估了短期的收益，却低估了长期的收益。对待一个新的技能，从零到一建设大脑皮层，总是伴随着挣扎，同时收效甚微。

这时候就需要我们有更多的耐心，先度过最开始的那段时光--那段付出了很多努力，却基本没有收获的时光。

千万不能半途而废，因为大脑皮层已经建立了一个半吊子的工程，比从一开始就新建工程， 那种修改纠正的难度要大很多。如果你的大脑皮层里都是一座座烂尾楼，你想想有多吓人。

We often overestimate short-term gains and underestimate long-term benefits. When learning a new skill, going from zero to one in building the brain's cortex is always accompanied by struggles and minimal returns.

It's crucial to have patience and push through the initial phase - a period of hard work with little to show for it.

Never give up halfway, as having a half-baked project in the brain's cortex is much harder to fix than starting anew. Imagine how daunting it would be if your brain was filled with half-finished buildings.
