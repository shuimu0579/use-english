从 2019 年加入定投人生课堂社群，到现在已经快 5 年的时间了。也正是 2019 年我从上海来到了深圳，然后结婚，孩子也在今年要出来了。

这 5 年的时间里，我从 30 岁到 35 岁，感受到了自己心态的不断变化。我变得越来越不想向外界展示自己，而是更喜欢用行动不断充满自己的内心世界。

这 5 年也是在投资世界里摸爬滚打的几年，经历过大风大浪，也更加的笃信自己能在这个投资世界里安全航行，不惧塞壬那优美又诱惑的歌声。

I joined the Life Investment Classroom community in 2019, and it's been almost 5 years now. In the same year, I moved from Shanghai to Shenzhen, got married, and our child is due to arrive this year.

During these 5 years, from age 30 to 35, I have noticed a continuous change in my mindset. I have become less inclined to showcase myself to the outside world and prefer to enrich my inner world through actions.

These 5 years have also been a period of learning and growing in the investment world, experiencing ups and downs, but I have grown more confident in navigating this realm safely, not succumbing to the seductive songs of the sirens.
