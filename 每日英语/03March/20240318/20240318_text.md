我反复的告诫自己，每天的英语口语文本，都是要背下来的，不能背下来就达不到练习的目的。

通过这几天的实践，我发现这些英文是能够背下来的，只要给到足够的时间。

我们的学习是学给自己的，不是在别人面前显摆的，只有自己真正的学到了东西，才是自己的成绩和收获。

通过持续的自我改进和自我监督，伴随着不断的自我鼓励，你肯定能学好用好英语的。

I keep reminding myself to memorize daily English speech texts. If not memorized, the practice purpose won't be achieved.

After a few days of practice, I've realized that these English texts can be memorized as long as enough time is given.

Our learning is for ourselves, not for showing off to others. Only when we truly learn something, it becomes our achievement and gain.

With continuous self-improvement, self-monitoring, and accompanied by constant self-encouragement, you will definitely excel in using English.
