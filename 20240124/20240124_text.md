今天放出了 2023 年的年度绩效，不上不下的一个绩效成绩。对于这个结果，我内心是能够接受的：为什么能够接受？是因为给别人打工是不可能有出路的，一定要自己做一番属于自己的事情，而不是把一天 8 个小时卖给公司。

处于当下的这个节点，我的孩子在 2024 年就要出生了，现在更好的策略还是去给公司打工。但是一定要时时的提醒自己，现在给别人打工是为了积蓄力量，为了以后可以独立的做自己的事情。

我需要更苛刻的珍惜自己的时间和注意力，投入到有意义有积累的生产活动中去。

The annual performance review for 2023 was released today, yielding a mediocre result. I find this outcome acceptable. The reason being that working for others offers no future prospects; one must carve out their own path, rather than selling eight hours a day to a company.

At this juncture, with my child due to be born in 2024, the best strategy is still to work for a company. However, I must continually remind myself that working for others now is about building strength to eventually pursue independent endeavors.

I must be more rigorous in cherishing my time and attention, investing them in productive activities that are meaningful and impactful.
